# 👥 Resourcing & Talent Strategy
> **Owner:** QA Lead / Manager  
> **Objective:** To build a high-performance, cost-effective Quality Engineering team using a "Flexible Core" model.

## 🏗️ 1. The "Flexible Core" Headcount Model
I advocate for a balanced team structure that ensures long-term institutional knowledge while maintaining the ability to scale for project peaks.

* **Internal Core (30-40%):** Strategic Leads & Architects. Owners of the [QA Manifesto](../01-Strategic-Governance/QA_PRINCIPLES.md) and Framework Architecture.
* **Embedded SDETs (40-50%):** Permanent or long-term contractors integrated into Scrum teams.
* **On-Demand Scaling (10-20%):** Specialist contractors or Outsourced partners for peak loads (e.g., Load Testing, Security Audits, or seasonal releases).

## 🔍 2. Recruitment & Technical Interviewing
I use a "Hands-on & Mind-on" approach to hiring SDETs:
1.  **The Mind (Process):** Can they explain the [RBT Matrix](../01-Strategic-Governance/RBT_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md)? Do they understand "Shift-Left"?
2.  **The Hands (Code):** A live "Pair-Programming" session rather than a take-home test. We focus on **Clean Code** and **Maintainability** over complex algorithms.
3.  **The Heart (Culture):** Do they align with our [Team Working Agreement](./TEAM_WORKING_AGREEMENT.md)?

## 🤝 3. Vendor & Outsourcing Management (SI/Managed Services)
When managing offshore or third-party partners, I enforce **Output-Based Governance** rather than "Body Shopping."

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Partners:
| Metric | Target | Lead Oversight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automation Contribution** | >70% of new features | Ensure scripts meet our [Automation Standards](../03-Operational-Delivery/AUTOMATION_STANDARDS_GOVERNANCE.md). |
| **Defect Rejection Rate** | <5% | Ensuring high-quality bug reporting to prevent developer friction. |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Quarterly | Mandatory documentation updates and walkthroughs. |

## 📈 4. Onboarding & Time-to-Value
I reduce the "Ramp-up" time for new hires from weeks to days by providing:
* **The "Starter Kit":** Pre-configured Docker environments for all 4 frameworks.
* **The Buddy System:** Pairing the new hire with a "Culture Guardian" for the first 2 weeks.
* **The 30/60/90 Day Plan:** Clear, measurable goals for their first quarter.

## 📜 5. IR35 & Contractor Management (UK/EU specific)
*I have experience navigating IR35 regulations (Inside/Outside), ensuring that Statement of Work (SoW) deliverables are clearly defined to maintain compliance while securing top-tier contractor talent.*
