# 🎯 Annual Performance & Goal Setting Framework
> **Strategy:** Aligning individual career aspirations with the [Quality Manifesto](../01-Strategic-Governance/QA_PRINCIPLES.md) and business ROI.

## 🏗️ 1. The QE Goal Pillars
Every annual appraisal for an SDET/QA should be balanced across these four pillars:

| Pillar | Objective | Example Metric (KR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Excellence** | Framework Contribution | "Implement 3 custom Playwright fixtures to reduce code duplication by 20%." |
| **Operational Impact** | Efficiency & Velocity | "Reduce the [Toil Ratio](./PEOPLE_METRICS.md) of the Mobile suite by 15% through data-seeding." |
| **Leadership & Culture** | Mentorship | "Lead 4 [Brown Bag sessions](./GROWTH_AND_ENABLEMENT.md) and onboard 2 new starters using the self-healing doc ritual." |
| **Business Alignment** | Risk Mitigation | "Achieve 0 critical [Defect Leakage](../04-Business-Value-ROI/QA_METRICS_DASHBOARD.md) for the 'Payments' module over 4 sprints." |

## 🗓️ 2. The Appraisal Lifecycle
I manage performance as a **continuous loop**, not a once-a-year surprise.

* **Q1 (Set):** Define 3-5 SMART goals using the [Skills Matrix](./SKILLS_MATRIX.md) to identify "Stretch" areas.
* **Q2 (Pivot):** Mid-year review. Adjust goals if project priorities have shifted (e.g., shifting focus from Selenium to Playwright).
* **Q3 (Push):** Focus on the "Leadership" pillar—speaking at sessions or documenting complex architectures.
* **Q4 (Assess):** Final appraisal based on evidence collected in the [People Metrics](./PEOPLE_METRICS.md) dashboard.

## 🧪 3. Sample Goal Template (Senior SDET)
**Goal:** Improve Automation Reliability.
* **Objective:** Stabilize the flaky "Checkout" suite.
* **Action:** Identify top 5 failing tests, refactor using "Web-First Assertions," and move to a "Zero-Retry" policy.
* **Measurement:** Suite pass rate increases from 85% to 98% by End of Q2.

## ⚖️ 4. Handling Underperformance (The PIP Protocol)
If a team member consistently misses targets, I move to a **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** focused on support:
1. **Root Cause:** Is it a Skill gap, a Tooling gap, or a Motivation gap?
2. **Weekly Syncs:** Short-term, tactical goals with immediate feedback.
3. **Paired Support:** Pairing with a "High Performer" to bridge technical gaps.
