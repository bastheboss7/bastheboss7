## 🏗️ 1. Scaling & Onboarding Efficiency
*Goal: Minimize the 'dead-time' between hiring and high-value delivery.*

| KPI | Target | Metric Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time-to-First-PR** | < 3 Days | Days from start date to first merged code/test fix. |
| **Onboarding Velocity** | < 10 Days | Days until a new hire is "Sprint-Independent" (requires <1 hour of senior support/day). |
| **Documentation Utility** | > 80% | Percentage of onboarding completed using the [Starter Kit](./RESOURCING_STRATEGY.md) without manual intervention. |

## 📈 2. Skill Growth & Competency
*Goal: Tracking the transformation from "Manual Tester" to "Quality Engineer."*

| KPI | Target | Metric Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upskilling Velocity** | Quarterly | Measured by movement across the [Skills Matrix](./SKILLS_MATRIX.md) (e.g., Junior → Mid-level SDET). |
| **Cross-Stack Proficiency** | > 60% Team | % of team members capable of contributing to at least 2 frameworks (e.g., Web + API). |
| **Certification/CPD Rate** | 100% | Ensuring every team member completes 1 professional development goal per quarter. |

## 🔋 3. Team Health & Sustainable Pace
*Goal: Preventing burnout and ensuring the "5:1 Dev-to-QA" ratio is sustainable.*

| KPI | Target | Metric Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Toil" Ratio** | < 20% | Time spent on manual regression/admin vs. Engineering/Innovation. |
| **Silo Heatmap** | 0 Critical | Number of critical framework components owned by only one person (Bus Factor). |
| **Sprint Sentiment** | > 4 / 5 | Qualitative score from Retrospectives on "Work-Life Balance" and "Tooling Satisfaction." |

## 🤝 4. Vendor & Contractor Performance
*Goal: Ensuring external partners deliver internal-quality standards.*

| KPI | Target | Metric Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PR Acceptance Rate** | > 90% | % of partner code that passes [Review Standards](../03-Operational-Delivery/AUTOMATION_STANDARDS_GOVERNANCE.md) on first attempt. |
| **Knowledge Retention** | 100% | Measured by the presence of 'Exit Documentation' for every contractor rolling off a project. |
| **Value-per-Head** | Positive | Comparison of contractor cost vs. Manual Effort saved ([ROI Model](../04-Business-Value-ROI/AUTOMATION_ROI_MODEL.md)). |

## 🛠️ The Lead's "People Dashboard" Strategy
> "I don't just manage headcount; I manage **Capability Capacity**. By tracking 'Time-to-First-PR', I can prove to the Business that my [Onboarding Strategy](./RESOURCING_STRATEGY.md) allows us to scale up for major releases with 40% less friction than traditional models."
