# 📊 QA Team Skills Matrix & Development Framework

> **Purpose:** To create a transparent, objective roadmap for every team member's growth in both manual and automated testing disciplines, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

This matrix is a tool for career development, not performance evaluation. It replaces subjective feedback with a clear, data-driven path for progression, enabling fair and constructive conversations about growth.

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Framework

1.  **Self-Assessment:** Team members first assess their own skills against the defined competencies.
2.  **Manager Review:** The QA Lead or manager reviews the self-assessment, adding their own perspective.
3.  **Development Conversation:** The team member and lead discuss any gaps and co-create a development plan with clear goals and timelines.
4.  **Regular Check-ins:** Progress is reviewed quarterly to adjust the plan and recognize growth.

## 🏯 Skill Levels

| Level | Definition | Typical Path |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Level 1: Learner** | Works under supervision; requires clear instructions and follows checklists. | Graduate → Level 1 |
| **Level 2: Practitioner** | Works independently on standard tasks; delivers reliable results with minimal oversight. | Level 1 → Level 2 (6-12 months) |
| **Level 3: Specialist** | Solves complex problems, handles edge cases, and begins to mentor others. | Level 2 → Level 3 (12-24 months) |
| **Level 4: Lead/Architect** | Sets strategy, defines standards, and actively coaches the team's growth. | Level 3 → Level 4 (2-3 years) |

## 🛠️ Core Competencies

### Manual & Exploratory Testing
- **Exploratory Testing:** Designs and executes unscripted, context-driven tests to discover unknown risks.
- **Security & Edge Cases:** Applies risk-based thinking to identify vulnerabilities in authentication, data handling, etc.
- **UX/Usability Evaluation:** Assesses the application from a user's perspective, focusing on ease of use and error recovery.
- **Documentation & Reporting:** Writes clear, concise defect reports with reproducible steps.

### Test Automation
- **Framework Proficiency:** Demonstrates mastery of core automation frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Appium, Selenium).
- **Programming & Design Patterns:** Applies best practices like the Page Object Model, BDD, and data-driven testing.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrates automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline, managing artifacts and reporting.
- **Debugging & Problem-Solving:** Efficiently identifies the root cause of test failures and resolves flaky tests.

### Quality Leadership
- **Risk-Based Strategy:** Uses frameworks like the [RBT Priority Matrix](./../01-Strategic-Governance/RBT_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md) to decide between manual and automated testing.
- **Defect Triage & Analysis:** Assesses defect severity, performs root cause analysis, and identifies quality trends.
- **Team Collaboration:** Facilitates "Three Amigos" sessions and communicates effectively with all stakeholders.
- **Continuous Learning:** Stays current with the latest tools, frameworks, and industry methodologies.

### Gen AI Integration (Emerging)
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafts effective prompts for test case generation, defect analysis, and exploratory guidance.
- **AI Tool Proficiency:** Uses Gen AI tools (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini) to accelerate testing tasks.
- **AI-Assisted Testing:** Leverages AI suggestions to guide manual exploratory testing and identify new edge cases.
- **Responsible AI:** Recognizes the limitations of Gen AI, verifies AI-generated outputs, and avoids over-reliance.

## 💬 Development Conversations: Examples

### Supporting Underperformance (Dev)
-   **Issue:** Low technical proficiency and misalignment with the [Team Working Agreement](./TEAM_WORKING_AGREEMENT.md).
-   **Approach:**
    1.  **Objective Conversation:** Use the matrix to clearly and kindly illustrate the performance gap.
    2.  **Mentorship:** Pair Dev with Alice (Level 4) on a key feature to provide hands-on guidance.
    3.  **Structured Plan:** Set a clear goal to reach Level 2 in Exploratory Testing within one quarter.
    4.  **Regular Check-ins:** Conduct weekly 1-on-1s to monitor progress and offer support.

### Strategic Upskilling (Bob)
-   **Goal:** Advance from Level 2 to Level 3 in API Testing.
-   **Action Plan:**
    *   Take ownership of the API automation suite for a new feature.
    *   Participate in peer review sessions with Alice.
    *   Document and share API testing best practices with the team.

### Leadership Pipeline (Alice)
-   **Goal:** Transition from a Senior Engineer to a QA Tech Lead.
-   **Action Plan:**
    *   Lead an "Exploratory Testing Workshop" for the team.
    *   Mentor two junior testers in automation and test strategy.
    *   Co-author updates to the [RBT Priority Matrix](./../01-Strategic-Governance/RBT_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md).
    *   Champion the adoption of Gen AI by piloting new use cases.
✅ **Growth Focus:** Emphasizes development, not punishment
