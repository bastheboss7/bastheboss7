## 🏯 Skill Levels

| Level | Definition | Typical Path |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Level 1: Learner** | Supervised work; requires shadowing. Follows checklists. | Graduate → Level 1 |
| **Level 2: Practitioner** | Works independently; completes standard tasks reliably. | Level 1 → Level 2 (6-12 months) |
| **Level 3: Specialist** | Solves complex problems; handles edge cases; mentors others. | Level 2 → Level 3 (12-24 months) |
| **Level 4: Lead/Architect** | Sets strategy; defines standards; coaches team growth. | Level 3 → Level 4 (2-3 years) |

## Core Testing Competencies

### Manual Testing Skills
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted, context-driven test design
- **Security & Edge Cases:** Risk-based thinking for authentication, data handling
- **UX/Usability Evaluation:** User perspective, error recovery, accessibility
- **Documentation & Reporting:** Clear defect reports with reproducible steps

### Automation Skills
- **Test Automation Framework:** Playwright, Appium, Rest-Assured, Selenium
- **Programming & Design Patterns:** Page Objects, BDD, data-driven testing
- **CI/CD Integration:** Pipeline integration, artifact management, reporting
- **Debugging & Problem-Solving:** Root cause analysis, flaky test resolution

### Quality Leadership Skills
- **Risk-Based Testing Strategy:** Deciding manual vs. automated effort
- **Defect Triage & Analysis:** Severity assessment, RCA, trend analysis
- **Team Collaboration:** Three Amigos, dependency communication, stakeholder updates
- **Continuous Learning:** Staying current with tools, frameworks, methodologies

### Gen AI Integration Skills (Emerging Competency)
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts for test case generation and defect analysis
- **Gen AI Tool Proficiency:** Using OpenAI/Gemini/Claude for testing guidance, RCA, and test design
- **AI-Assisted Exploratory Testing:** Leveraging Gen AI suggestions to guide manual testing strategies
- **Synthetic Data & Mocking:** Understanding Gen AI-generated test data and its reliability
- **Responsible AI:** Recognizing Gen AI limitations, verifying AI-generated test cases, avoiding over-reliance

## Development Conversations

### Example 1: Supporting Underperformance (Dev)
**Issue:** Low technical proficiency + low adherence to Team Working Agreement  
**Approach (Supportive, Not Punitive):**
1. **Honest Conversation:** Clearly map the gap using this matrix
2. **Pair with Mentor:** Dev pairs with Alice (Level 4) on "Login Flow" scenarios
3. **Structured Plan:** Goal is Level 2 in Exploratory Testing within 8 weeks
4. **Regular Check-ins:** Weekly 1-on-1s to track progress
5. **Path Forward:** If growth happens → continue development; if not → explore better fit

### Example 2: Strategic Upskilling (Bob)
**Goal:** Move from Level 2 → Level 3 in API Testing  
**Action Plan:**
- Ownership of OAuth/MFA API automation suite
- Pair review sessions with Alice
- Document best practices for the team

### Example 3: Leadership Pipeline (Alice)
**Goal:** Transition to QA Tech Lead  
**Action Plan:**
- Lead "Exploratory Testing Workshop" for team
- Mentor 2-3 testers in strategy & design
- Co-author RBT matrix updates
- Champion Gen AI adoption (pilot test case generation, share best practices)

### Example 4: Emerging Gen AI Specialist (Bob)
**Goal:** Develop Gen AI proficiency from Level 1 → Level 3  
**Action Plan:**
- Weekly "Prompt Engineering for Testing" sessions
- Generate 10 test scenarios using Gen AI; compare with manual test design
- Document Gen AI limitations and when human judgment overrides AI suggestions
- Lead Gen AI RCA pilot for post-mortems

## Why This Works

✅ **Transparency:** Everyone understands the career ladder  
✅ **Objectivity:** Removes personal bias from decisions  
✅ **Safety:** Difficult conversations become "technical roadmaps"  
✅ **Fairness:** Same standards applied across the team  
✅ **Growth Focus:** Emphasizes development, not punishment
