# 🤝 Team Working Agreement (The High-Trust Model)
*Purpose: To establish a culture of psychological safety, accountability, and respect.*

### 1. Communication & Ethics
* **Private Feedback:** All constructive feedback is shared 1-2-1. Public praise, private coaching.
* **Blameless Culture:** We fix the system, not the person. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) focuses on process gaps.
* **Radical Candor:** We speak up early if a deadline is at risk. There are no "bad news" penalties.

### 2. Digital Boundaries (Work-Life Balance)
* **Right to Disconnect:** No Slack/Teams messages expected after 5:30 PM or on weekends.
* **Deep Work:** No-meeting Wednesdays to allow engineers to focus on complex automation logic.

### 3. Empowerment & Autonomy
* **The "How":** As a Lead, I define the 'What' (Goals) and 'Why' (Value). The Engineer defines the 'How' (Implementation).
* **Skills Matrix:** Performance is measured against an objective matrix, ensuring fair growth opportunities for all team members.
