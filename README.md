# Hi, I'm Baskar 👋
### QA Leadership for the Modern Era

**Read my [Quality Engineering Manifesto](01-Strategic-Governance/QA_PRINCIPLES.md) to understand my leadership philosophy.**

**Driving the future of QA by blending human expertise, robust automation, and Gen AI. My portfolio demonstrates proven impact across all three pillars—making me an ideal fit for Senior Manual QA, Senior Automation, and Gen AI-driven QA leadership roles.**

## 👨‍💻 About Me

**The 3-Pillar Quality Strategy**
As a QA Leader, I build comprehensive testing ecosystems that balance speed, coverage, and human insight. My approach moves teams beyond "script-passing" and into Quality Engineering, using Gen AI as a force multiplier. For details on strategy, manual, automation, and Gen AI capabilities, see the 3 Pillars below.




🏛️ **Pillar 1: Strategic Governance & Maturity**
Moving organizations from Ad-hoc (L1) to Optimized (L5).

- **Organizational Maturity:** Implementing TMMi Level 5 standards ([QA Strategy Roadmap](./01-Strategic-Governance/QA_STRATEGY_ROADMAP.md)) with a focus on people, culture, and process.
- **Risk-Based Testing (RBT):** Utilizing [Analytical Priority Matrices](./01-Strategic-Governance/RBT_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md) to allocate resources where they matter most.
- **Shift-Left Leadership:** Facilitating [Three Amigos](./03-Operational-Delivery/THREE_AMIGOS_CHECKLIST.md) and Quality Gates to eliminate defects at the requirement stage.
- **Human-Centric Manual QA:** Evolving manual testing into high-value [Exploratory Charters](./05-Practical-Examples/TEST_SCENARIO_TEMPLATES.md), Persona-based UX validation, advanced exploratory techniques, UAT/regression, and [cross-browser/manual accessibility testing](./05-Practical-Examples/DEFECT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md).




🤖 **Pillar 2: Technical Automation Architecture**
Building high-performance "Golden Pipelines" and resilient frameworks.

- **Enterprise Frameworks:** Architecting scalable Playwright, Selenium, and Appium frameworks ([Playwright WebUI](https://github.com/bastheboss7/Playwright_WebUI), [WebBrowserAutomation_BDD_Framework](https://github.com/bastheboss7/WebBrowserAutomation_BDD_Framework), [MobileAutomation_BDD_Framework](https://github.com/bastheboss7/MobileAutomation_BDD_Framework)) from the ground up.
- **CI/CD Engineering:** Implementing Test Sharding and parallel execution ([Multi-Layer Automation Strategy](./01-Strategic-Governance/TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md)) to achieve the "10-Minute Feedback Loop."
- **Hybrid Strategy:** Combining UI precision with API-driven data seeding ([API Automation](https://github.com/bastheboss7/evri-api-automation-framework)) to ensure 100% test isolation and speed.
- **Observability:** Driving data-driven decisions through rich Allure reporting and automated failure triage ([Case Study](./04-Business-Value-ROI/CASE_STUDY_TRANSFORMATION.md)).
- **Mentorship:** See Pillar 2 for details on team coaching, code reviews, and best practices ([Skills Matrix](./02-People-Operations/SKILLS_MATRIX.md)).




✨ **Pillar 3: Gen AI-Accelerated Engineering**
Leveraging LLMs as a force multiplier for the entire Quality Lifecycle.

- **AI-Accelerated Design:** Using LLMs to transform User Stories into Gherkin scenarios and Page Objects ([GenAI-QA-Planning-Project](https://github.com/bastheboss7/GenAI-QA-Planning-Project), [Gen AI Transformation Guide](./04-Business-Value-ROI/GEN_AI_TRANSFORMATION.md)).
- **Intelligent Triage:** Implementing AI-driven RCA agents to parse logs and categorize failures automatically ([GenAI-Jira-Integration](https://github.com/bastheboss7/GenAI-Jira-Integration)).
- **Exploratory Guidance:** Leveraging AI to suggest "unknown-unknown" edge cases for manual testers to validate ([Test Scenario Templates](./05-Practical-Examples/TEST_SCENARIO_TEMPLATES.md)).
- **Synthetic Data:** Generating complex, non-PII test data sets to increase coverage without compromising security ([Gen AI Transformation Guide](./04-Business-Value-ROI/GEN_AI_TRANSFORMATION.md)).
