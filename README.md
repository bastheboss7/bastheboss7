## 👨‍💻 About Me

As a **QA Leader**, I build comprehensive testing strategies that balance **speed, coverage, and human insight**. I believe the best quality comes from combining automated regression with skilled manual testing—not replacing one with the other.

My approach leverages **Gen AI as a force multiplier**:
* **Risk-Based Decision Making:** Allocating resources where they matter most—critical features and high-failure areas.
* **Hybrid Quality Architecture:** Combining the precision of Playwright/Selenium with AI-driven exploratory insights.
* **AI-Accelerated Engineering:** Implementing LLMs to automate the QA process & boiler plate automation codes.
* **Organizational Maturity:** Helping teams evolve from **Level 1 (Ad-hoc)** to **Level 5 (Optimized)**, with emphasis on people and culture alongside processes.
