## 🤖 AI-Accelerated Engineering
I leverage Generative AI and LLMs to compress the SDLC and build more resilient frameworks:
- **Prompt Engineering:** Developed custom system prompts to generate Page Objects and boilerplate code, reducing manual coding time by 60%.
- **Synthetics & Mocking:** Used LLMs to generate realistic, diverse test data (JSON/XML) for API contract testing.
- **Architectural Partnering:** Utilized AI as a thought partner for designing thread-safe `DriverManager` patterns and complex regex for log parsing.
