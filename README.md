## 👨‍💻 About Me


As a **QA Leader**, I build comprehensive testing strategies that balance **speed, coverage, and human insight**. I believe the best quality comes from combining automated regression with skilled manual testing—not replacing one with the other.

My approach focuses on three strategic pillars:
* **Risk-Based Decision Making:** Allocating resources where they matter most—critical features, high-failure areas, and human-centric scenarios.
* **Scalable Test Strategy:** Automating what's repeatable; keeping what requires judgment and creativity in the hands of skilled testers.
* **Gen AI-Accelerated Testing:** Leveraging LLMs to boost both manual and automation efficiency—from test design to failure analysis to exploratory guidance.

## � Testing Philosophy & Governance
I guide QA transformation using proven frameworks:
- **Risk-Based Testing (RBT):** Strategic allocation of manual vs. automated testing effort based on business impact.
- **ISTQB Principles:** Expertise in test design, defect analysis, and quality assurance fundamentals—not just tool proficiency.
- **Hybrid Testing Models:** Combining exploratory, manual testing with automation for maximum coverage and efficiency.
- **Organizational Maturity:** Helping teams evolve from **Level 1 (Ad-hoc)** to **Level 5 (Optimized)**, with emphasis on people and culture alongside processes.

## 🤖 Gen AI-Powered Quality Strategy
**Gen AI enhances both manual and automation testing—it's not an automation tool, it's a force multiplier.**

### Manual Testing + Gen AI
- **Exploratory Guidance:** LLMs provide context-aware testing suggestions for edge cases and risk areas
- **Smart Defect Reporting:** Auto-summarize bugs with root cause hypotheses and reproduction steps
- **Test Data Generation:** Synthetic, realistic test scenarios (JSON, XML, user personas) for manual test execution
- **Accessibility & UX Insights:** AI flags potential usability issues before manual testers investigate

### Automation + Gen AI
- **Test Design Acceleration:** Generate Gherkin scenarios and test cases from user stories in seconds
- **Self-Healing Framework:** AI-adaptive locators and intelligent retry logic for flaky test resilience
- **Failure Triage & RCA:** Automated root-cause analysis, log parsing, and Jira ticket generation
- **Performance Insights:** AI-powered performance profiling and bottleneck identification

### Cross-Functional Impact
- **50% reduction** in test design time (story → testable scenarios)
- **40% fewer flaky failures** (self-healing, intelligent waits)
- **60% faster incident triage** (AI-assisted RCA and defect summaries)
- **Team upskilling:** Manual testers focus on strategy; automation engineers focus on architecture
