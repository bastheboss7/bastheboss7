# Hi, I'm Baskar 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

As a **Lead QA Consultant**, I specialize in designing high-performance testing ecosystems that don't just find bugs, but accelerate the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

With a deep focus on **Web, Mobile, and API layers**, I build frameworks that are:
* **Scalable:** Leveraging Cloud Grids like **BrowserStack** and **Docker** for massive parallelization.
* **Thread-Safe:** Engineered with advanced Java/TypeScript patterns to ensure 100% reliable execution.
* **AI-Enhanced:** I utilize **LLMs and Prompt Engineering** to automate boilerplate code generation, log analysis, and Jira triage, reducing framework maintenance by 40%.


## 🏛️ Quality Governance & Strategy
Beyond automation, I specialize in maturing QA organizations using Agile and industry-standard frameworks:
- **ISTQB Certified:** Expert in Test Design, Risk Analysis, and Defect Management.
- **SAFe Agile Practitioner:** Deep experience in Scaled Agile Frameworks, participating in PI Planning and cross-team dependency management.
- **Test Maturity Matrix (TMMi):** Engineered a strategic roadmap to transition QA teams from **Level 1 (Initial)** to **Level 5 (Optimized)**, focusing on process repeatability and preventative testing.

- **Architecture:** Factory Pattern, Singleton, ThreadLocal Concurrency.
- **Methodologies:** BDD (Gherkin), Shift-Left Testing, CI/CD Pipeline Success.

## 🤖 AI-Accelerated Engineering
I leverage Generative AI and LLMs to compress the SDLC and build more resilient frameworks:
- **Prompt Engineering:** Developed custom system prompts to generate Page Objects and boilerplate code, reducing manual coding time by 60%.
- **Synthetics & Mocking:** Used LLMs to generate realistic, diverse test data (JSON/XML) for API contract testing.
- **Architectural Partnering:** Utilized AI as a thought partner for designing thread-safe `DriverManager` patterns and complex regex for log parsing.
