# 🚀 30-60-90 Day Strategic Integration Plan
> **Objective:** To transition into the Lead role by building trust, auditing the existing technical landscape, and delivering early wins through the [Quality Manifesto](./QA_PRINCIPLES.md).

---

## 🏁 Phase 1: The First 30 Days (Observation & Alignment)
*Goal: Understand the "As-Is" state and build relationships with key stakeholders.*

* **Stakeholder Interviews:** Meet with Product Owners, Dev Leads, and QA peers to identify pain points (e.g., "The pipeline is too slow" or "Requirements are unclear").
* **Technical Audit:** Deep-dive into the current tech stack. Evaluate framework stability, flakiness index, and CI/CD integration.
* **Process Mapping:** Document the current lifecycle from Requirement → Production. Identify where the biggest "Quality Leakage" occurs.
* **Cultural Integration:** Establish a cadence for 1-on-1s and introduce the [Team Working Agreement](../02-People-Operations/TEAM_WORKING_AGREEMENT.md) concept.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: The Next 30 Days (Optimization & Standards)
*Goal: Implement governance and deliver a "Quick Win" to prove ROI.*

* **Gap Analysis:** Map findings from the audit against the [QA Maturity Matrix](./QA_STRATEGY_ROADMAP.md).
* **Technical Standardization:** Introduce the [Automation Standards](../03-Operational-Delivery/AUTOMATION_STANDARDS_GOVERNANCE.md) to harmonize coding patterns across teams.
* **Early Win:** Pick one high-friction area (e.g., a flaky critical test) and apply the [Pruning Policy](../04-Business-Value-ROI/AUTOMATION_ROI_MODEL.md) to stabilize the pipeline.
* **Resourcing Review:** Review the [Skills Matrix](../02-People-Operations/SKILLS_MATRIX.md) and identify training needs or recruitment gaps.

---

## 📈 Phase 3: The Full 90 Days (Transformation & Innovation)
*Goal: Scale the strategy and establish a "Continuous Quality" culture.*

* **Shift-Left Implementation:** Fully embed the [Three Amigos Checklist](../03-Operational-Delivery/THREE_AMIGOS_CHECKLIST.md) into the sprint cycle.
* **Gen AI Pilot:** Launch the first AI-accelerated initiative (e.g., [Automated Log Analysis](../04-Business-Value-ROI/GEN_AI_TRANSFORMATION.md)) to reduce triage time.
* **ROI Reporting:** Present the first **Quality Value Report** to leadership, showing measurable improvements in Defect Leakage and Execution Speed.
* **Self-Sustaining Teams:** Empower the team to own the governance, moving my role from "Directing" to "Coaching & Architecting."

> **Success Metric:** By Day 90, the team should have a clear [Maturity Roadmap](./QA_STRATEGY_ROADMAP.md), a stabilized automation suite, and a unified engineering culture that treats quality as a shared responsibility.
